The data set contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders. From the data given we have to predict whether a given transaction is fraud or genuine.

The data set is modified with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to maintain confidentiality.

The features include ‘time’, ‘amount’, and the other ones (V1, V2, V3, up to V28) are the principal components obtained using PCA. The number of fraudulent cases is very high compared to the non-fraudulent here.
